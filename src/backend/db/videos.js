    My take on investing: Under 10% of portfolio in individual companies, 90%+ in index funds. Picking stocks is inherently not the smartest move! Long term investing in the market IS the smart move.

    With the Russia-Ukraine situation affecting the markets, this could be a very interesting entry point for those of you who waited to invest. Stocks are overall down quite a bit (take a look at the S&P 500 since the start of 2022) However, I want to reiterate that index fund investing is the best way to invest for long-term wealth, so if you can, try and keep a small portion of your portfolio in individual companies.
    
    These are LONG TERM PICKS - for short term, all of these companies can go down or up. Do NOT trade options with these companies as their price movement can be all over the place, especially during earnings. The overall market is down, especially higher growth sectors like tech. And volatility is everywhere.    `,

Iseult Gillespie dives into Murakami’s mind-bending and whimsical novel.
